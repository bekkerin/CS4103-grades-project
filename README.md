# CS4103-grades-project
Practice project for the final exam in CS4103 Software Testing

The project is a self-contained package using Java and the TestNG framework based on the textbook used for the class:
Essentials of Software Testing by Ralf Bierig, Stephen Brown, Edgar Galv√°n, and  Joe Timoney.
ISBN-13 978-1108833349
Available on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Software-Testing-Ralf-Bierig-ebook-dp-B09B3WXPBL/dp/B09B3WXPBL/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1644349168

Before you try to run the project, I recommend installing the software and running the execution scripts to make sure that the project can run without problems. You can find the execution scripts at https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/essentials-of-software-testing/5BEA8B9CB2E001E014CE0FDD7F41F3E9/resources/student-resources/B88F1744511576B05C5891F27743CC3B/code/FC2BD453D6A44CA120983885DCBEDB8D . The library files in the Libraries folder run on my machine. For Java, I used  JDK 18. The direct link is https://download.oracle.com/java/18/archive/jdk-18.0.2_windows-x64_bin.msi and you can find other versions on https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html .
I got an error message in the comple process that the parent directory could not be created. It appears to be related to using a different drive than the C drive. Once I placed the Code folder in C:\Users\<user>\Desktop (directly on the local desktop) it worked just fine.
Finally, make sure to run the book files and the project from the terminal. 
The grading.bat file contains all the java commands to  run the project.

I run the project in Visual Studio Code. In the terminal, make sure to change to the directory where the grading.bat file is located. Use cd (change directory) as needed. To go to a subdirectory: cs (subdirectory). To go up one level: cd ..
